# <a name="attributes"></a> Attributes

An **Attribute** is a general area of capability in which a creature's potential is measured. There are three attributes used in {{ page.system_name }}: Mind, Body, and Spirit. Each creature has an attribute score corresponding to each of these three attributes, which together represent that creature's raw mental, physical, and spiritual ability.

> Each creature has three attribute scores, corresponding to the three primary attributes: Mind, Body, and Spirit. Attribute scores are added to the dice roll to resolve attribute checks and skill checks, and determine some basic creature stats including maximum Vitality and other token pools.

## Attribute Scores

A creature's attribute scores provide a numerical measure of that creature's basic physical, mental, and spiritual aptitude. In most games, an attribute score of 3 for one of the three attributes indicates that the creature is roughly equal in base physical, mental, and spiritual strength to an average human. Equivalently, an average human has attribute scores of 3 for each of his or her attributes.

A higher score reflects a significant increase in capability relative to an average human, with a score of 6 representing the strongest, smartest, or most spiritually connected natural human. Equipment, special abilities, or other effects can raise a human character's attribute scores above 6. In addition, other creatures may have an innate bonus to one or more attribute scores. For example, a Bridge Troll (with a hearty +2 racial bonus to Body) would have an average Body score of 5, and a truly exceptional specimen would have a score of 8 (representing the pinnacle of Bridge Troll physicality).

Conversely, a lower score represents a lack or weakness in that attribute. As a rule, characters always have at least a 2 in each of their attribute scores to be viable, and creatures should have at least a 1 in each attribute score. An attribute score of 0 represents a crippling disability in that area. A Mind score of 0 represents animal intelligence, a Body score of 0 represents total physical breakdown, and a Spirit score of 0 represents a complete blindness toward the higher (and lower) planes.

A creature can also have an attribute score of None or —, indicating that that attribute does not apply to that creature. For example, a ghost or specter with no physical form might have a Body score of —; likewise, a mindless golem or construct would have a Mind score of —. If the golem were technological rather than magical in nature, e.g. a steampunk clockwork automaton, it might also have a Spirit score of — indicating no connection to the magical world. When a check or ability for a creature with an attribute score of — to use that attribute, the effect usually does not apply to that creature; in rare cases when a numeric score is necessary, treat an attribute score of — as a score of 0.

## Mind, Body, and Spirit

{{ page.system_name }} uses three basic or major attributes, each representing a facet of the character or creature's overall potential. These three attributes are Mind, Body, and Spirit.

### The Mind Attribute

The **Mind attribute** is a representation of a creature's raw mental potential. A creature's Mind score determines how many skills it can learn, the power of its magical abilities, and the effectiveness of skills based on knowledge, reason, or intuition.

A creature with a high Mind score is intelligent and perceptive. It may be highly logical and deductive, or inductive and prone to mental leaps that others have a difficult time following. It will often be contemplative, preferring to carefully consider all possibilities before action, but it may be forward or even reckless, trusting its intellect to help it choose the right path in a heartbeat.

A creature with a low Mind score has difficulty following logic or reasoning. It may be slow and deliberative, afraid of making the wrong decision, or it may be rash and impulsive, preferring immediate action over careful contemplation. A creature with a Mind score of 0 or less is of animal intelligence.

A creature with no Mind score (represented as —) is literally mindless. It may be controlled by some external intelligence, such as a construct or golem, or it could be a creature of unbridled instinct or programming, incapable of reason.

### The Body Attribute

The **Body attribute** is a representation of a creature's physical fitness. A creature's Body score determines how well the creature can attack, defend, and weather damage, and the effectiveness of skills based on strength, agility, or endurance.

A creature with a high Body score is strong, fast, and resilient. It may be a hulking brute with limbs like tree trunks, or graceful and agile with a wiry frame, or even a big lump that seems to simply shrug off damage and physical effects that would fell any lesser creature.

A creature with a low Body score is physically weak and clumsy. It may move slowly and cautiously or be prone to mishaps, it will have trouble trying to move or lift things others find effortless, and it will be easily tired by exertion and incapacitated by hurt. A creature with a Body score of 0 or less is physically harmless.

A creature with no Body score (represented as —) has no physical form. It could be a ghost or specter, an intangible illusion, or other effect which is not directly influenced by worldly events.

### The Spirit Attribute

The **Spirit attribute** is a representation of a creature's magical, spiritual or extrasensory attunement. A creature's Spirit score determines how often or how long the creature can use special abilities, how quickly it can respond in combat, and the effectiveness of skills based on willpower, charisma, or force of character.

A creature with a high Spirit score is unshakable and determined, possessing an indomitable will for good or ill. It can easily influence others by word or action. It may be charismatic or enigmatic, enthusiastic or unflappable. A willful sorcerer can use a high Spirit score to power mighty feats of magic, a sly rogue can use a high Spirit score to trick his way past a guard, or a mighty dragon can use a high Spirit score to charm villagers into its service.

A creature with a low Spirit score is easily demoralized. It can be craven and cowardly, or determined to overcome its fears. It may be frustrated by its lack of gifts or simply prefer to rely on direct methods. Creatures with a low Spirit score tend to interact poorly with other creatures, although taking socially-oriented skills can allow the creature to overcome this.

A creature with no Spirit score (represented as —) has no will or personality of its own. It could be a construct or golem, an animate object, or some other creature with no soul or spirit.

> #### What Does The Spirit Attribute Represent?
>
> Of the three Attributes, Spirit is the most dependent on the setting and on the character. What the Spirit stat represents can vary from game to game and even from creature to creature. In a traditional sword-and-sorcery fantasy setting, for example, Spirit could be used to represent the inner strength needed to channel magic. In a futuristic space opera setting, Spirit could represent a creature's mental resilience and ability to use telepathic talents. In general, if a creature's special power is measured through applied intelligence and long training, it will use the Mind attribute; otherwise, special abilities are tied to the Spirit attribute. In addition, Spirit is closely tied to a creature's initiative and morale.

## Minor Attributes

A **Minor Attribute** is a specific facet or aspect of one of the three major attributes, namely Mind, Body, and Spirit. Minor attributes allow a greater degree of specialization and specificity when designing creatures and characters at the cost of additional complexity.

### Minor Attribute Scores

Each creature in a game using minor attributes has a minor attribute score associated with each of the seven minor attributes (see below). Unless otherwise stated, a creature's minor attribute score in each of the minor attributes is the same as the creature's attribute score in the related major attribute, so a creature with a Mind score of 2 would have Intellect and Intuition scores of 2 unless otherwise noted.

Generally speaking, only characters and important Narrator-controlled creatures will use minor attributes; average enemies and encounters should use only the three major attributes for simplicity.

### Seven Minor Attributes

There are a total of seven minor attributes: three for the Body attribute and two each for Mind and Spirit.

#### Faith [Spirit]

The **Faith** minor attribute is a representation of a creature’s confidence and belief, whether in itself or in an external cause or entity. A creature would use faith to persuade a guard, to shake off the effect of a demoralizing shout, or to channel energy to ward away the undead.

#### Fortune [Spirit]

The **Fortune** minor attribute is a representation of a creature’s luck, whether good or ill. A creature would use fortune to win a hand of cards, to choose the unpoisoned drink, or to pick which campsite is safer from random attack.

#### Intellect [Mind]

The **Intellect** minor attribute is a representation of a creature’s ability to reason and to apply logic and deduction. A creature would use intellect to memorize a message, to decipher a code, or to solve a riddle.

#### Intuition [Mind]

The **Intuition** minor attribute is a representation of a creature’s awareness of itself and its surroundings. A creature would use intuition to notice a hidden trap, to follow a set of tracks, or to uncover the perfidy of the evil chancellor.

#### Stamina [Body]

The **Stamina** minor attribute is a representation of a creature’s resilience and ability to endure pain and fatigue. A creature would use stamina to run a marathon, to shake off a poison, or to resist the petrifying gaze of a basilisk. The Stamina minor attribute is also used to determine a creature’s Vitality pool.

#### Strength [Body]

The **Strength** minor attribute is a representation of a creature’s ability to push, pull, lift, and otherwise manipulate its environment through raw force. A creature would use strength to lift a large boulder, to kick in a door, or to swing a heavy weapon.

#### Swiftness [Body]

The **Swiftness** minor attribute is a representation of a creature’s speed and grace. A creature would use swiftness to pick a pocket, to dodge an arrow, or to swing a light weapon or use a ranged weapon.
