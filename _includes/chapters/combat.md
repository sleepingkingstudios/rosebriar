Characters can be fragile things. Between bandits' swords and arrows, ancient tomb guardians, dragon's fire, spider venom, a hostile sorcerer's acid spray, and a host of varied and insidious environmental hazards, there are a lot of ways for a character to get hurt - and, conversely, many ways for a character to dish out the pain to his or her foes.

**Damage** is a catch-all term used to describe most ways a character can face injury or worse. A unit of damage is called a "point", so we might say that a spear attack inflicts "one point of damage", or that after a fall a character "takes three points of damage".

### Damage Types

Generally, in the {{ page.system_name }} system, a point of damage is a point of damage, whether it results from a hail of arrows or a scorching fireball. This abstracts away a great deal of complexity. Sometimes, however, the source of injury matters, particularly for creatures that may be particularly resistant or particularly vulnerable to damage from a particular source. A plant monster, for example, might be vulnerable to fire attacks, while a ghost might ignore any sources of physical harm.

{{ page.system_name }} handles these cases using damage types. It is important to note that most of the time, damage types are invisible. One point of fire energy damage and one point of wood bludgeoning damage have exactly the same effect on a character or creature unless there is an explicit effect that alters or triggers on one of those types. There are no complicated type charts to memorize - weapons, spells and abilities will always tell you what kind of damage they deal, and creatures will always explicitly list any weaknesses or resistances.

#### Physical Damage

**Physical damage** represents being struck, pierced, cut, or otherwise violently injured by a physical object. Some creatures may be resistant or even immune to all physical damage, such as ghosts or other incorporeal entities. The most common source of physical damage is weapon attacks, whether that is a character's sword or arrow or a creature's claw slash or tail slap. Some spells will also inflict physical damage, such as a slashing blade of air, a whip of vines, or a punishing hail of stones.

Physical damage is further subdivided into bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage (see below). Only a few effects will inflict raw physical damage as a difficult-to-resist catch-all type, such as being crushed by a trap or a rock fall. In addition to the type or subtype, physical damage can be characterized by the material used to inflict the damage, such as wood, stone, or metal.

##### Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing Damage

Generally, most sources of physical damage will inflict one of three physical damage subtypes:

*Bludgeoning damage* is caused by blunt force, ranging from a blow from a club or staff to the fist of an angry giant.

*Piercing damage* is caused by a deep stab injury, such as a thief's dirk, an arrow or crossbow bolt, or the head of a pike.

*Slashing damage* is caused by a cutting injury, such as a monster's claws, a sword slash, or a spinning blade trap.

##### Material Damage

Some creatures may have additional vulnerability to specific materials, particularly those related to the fundamental elements of wood, stone, water, air, or metal. For example, a wooden quarterstaff would inflict wood bludgeoning damage, an iron-tipped arrow would inflict metal piercing damage, and a spell that conjured an invisible blade of wind would inflict air slashing damage. In addition, some effects may treat "corrosive" as a material for damage purposes, such as a giant wurm's gullet inflicting corrosive physical damage each round.

#### Energy Damage

Not all dangers are tangible - the burn of a fire, the chill of a winter blizzard, or a bolt of lightning can kill as easily as any sword. Energy damage is non-physical and will bypass any protections or resistances to physical damage. It is typically inflicted by magical spells or abilities or by environmental hazards.

##### Elemental Damage

Most sources of energy damage are of the elemental damage subtype.

*Fire damage* is caused by flame or extreme heat, and commonly inflicted by fire magic.

*Cold damage* is caused by bitter cold, and commonly inflicted by water magic.

*Lightning damage* is caused by electricity, and commonly inflicted by air magic.

A few effects can cause raw elemental damage, such as certain powerful spells.

##### Spiritual Damage

The energies of the realms above and below are inimical to mere mortals. They are especially effective against creatures aligned with the opposing power, and against the undead, whose unnatural forms cannot abide either holy or unholy energies.

*Light damage* is caused by exposure to powerful holy energies. It can be inflicted by powerful divine magics or creatures of an angelic nature. It is particularly effective when battling demons.

*Shadow damage* is caused by exposure to diabolical energies. It can be inflicted by powerful divine magics or creatures of a demonic nature. It is particularly effective when battling angels.

### Vitality and Wounds

Every creature has a pool of **Vitality tokens**, with a maximum token count or **Vitality pool** equal to their Body score. When a creature takes damage, remove one vitality token per point of damage. Spent vitality tokens represent the effects of a near miss or a glancing blow - not enough to seriously injure the creature, but enough to slow or tire it, rendering the creature more vulnerable to subsequent attacks.

If the creature has fewer vitality tokens than points of damage taken, then each remaining point of damage is instead applied to the creature as a **Wound token**. Wound tokens represent a serious injury to the character or creature. Each wound token inflicts a cumulative `-1` penalty to all checks until it is healed, so a creature with 3 wound tokens will suffer a `-3` penalty to all checks.

##### *Example*

Adara is fighting a group of cruel bandits. Midway through the battle, she has `2` vitality tokens remaining. One of the bandits hits her with a crossbow, inflicting `1` point of damage, so she loses one vitality token, leaving her with `1` token. Another bandit strikes her with a vicious greatsword, inflicting `2` more points of damage. Adara loses her one vitality token, and since she has no more vitality tokens to lose, she takes the remaining point of damage as a wound token. She now suffers a `-1` penalty to all checks.
