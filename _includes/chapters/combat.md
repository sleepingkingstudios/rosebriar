Characters can be fragile things. Between bandits' swords and arrows, ancient tomb guardians, dragon's fire, spider venom, a hostile sorcerer's acid spray, and a host of varied and insidious environmental hazards, there are a lot of ways for a character to get hurt - and, conversely, many ways for a character to dish out the pain to his or her foes.

**Damage** is a catch-all term used to describe most ways a character can face injury or worse. A unit of damage is called a "point", so we might say that a spear attack inflicts "one point of damage", or that after a fall a character "takes three points of damage".

### Damage Types

### Vitality and Wounds

Every creature has a pool of **Vitality tokens**, with a maximum token count or **Vitality pool** equal to their Body score. When a creature takes damage, remove one vitality token per point of damage. Spent vitality tokens represent the effects of a near miss or a glancing blow - not enough to seriously injure the creature, but enough to slow or tire it, rendering the creature more vulnerable to subsequent attacks.

If the creature has fewer vitality tokens than points of damage taken, then each remaining point of damage is instead applied to the creature as a **Wound token**. Wound tokens represent a serious injury to the character or creature. Each wound token inflicts a cumulative `-1` penalty to all checks until it is healed, so a creature with 3 wound tokens will suffer a `-3` penalty to all checks.

##### *Example*

Adara is fighting a group of cruel bandits. Midway through the battle, she has `2` vitality tokens remaining. One of the bandits hits her with a crossbow, inflicting `1` point of damage, so she loses one vitality token, leaving her with `1` token. Another bandit strikes her with a vicious greatsword, inflicting `2` more points of damage. Adara loses her one vitality token, and since she has no more vitality tokens to lose, she takes the remaining point of damage as a wound token. She now suffers a `-1` penalty to all checks.
