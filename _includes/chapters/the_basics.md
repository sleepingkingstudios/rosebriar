## The Players and the Narrator

At its core, playing a roleplaying game is about telling a story with a group of friends. Most of the players will have a character of their own, whose adventures are written into legend. But one of the players has a very special role - to control the people and monsters of the world, to lay out the plot, and to keep the game moving and the fun coming. He or she is the voice that starts the adventure with the immortal words, "So you all meet at an inn, or something." This player is called **the Narrator** (and, subsequently, references to "the players" refer to everyone else).

Being the Narrator is a big responsibility, but a rewarding one. The Narrator keeps the game moving, adjudicates disputes and in-game situations, and serves as the final arbiter of the rules.

> #### Collaboration, Not Competition
>
> It's important to remember that everyone, players and Narrator alike, are on the same side, even (or especially!) if their respective characters are not. The Narrator sets the tone of the game, and controls the antagonists of the story. That doesn't mean that the Narrator is or should be out to kill or thwart the characters: his or her job is to put meaningful challenges in front of the characters so that the story can progress, the characters can evolve, and everyone can have fun. Conversely, the players should aim to foil the plans of villains, not the Narrator.

## <a name="the-check"></a> The Check

> #### At A Glance
>
> Roll two six-sided dice and add the result and any applicable modifiers. If the total is greater than or equal to the difficulty value of the task, the action succeeded; otherwise the action failed.

The **Check** is the basic task resolution system in {{ page.system_name }}. Simply put, you "perform a check" to determine whether or not an action was successful. Swinging a sword, throwing a fireball or resisting an insidious curse, sneaking past or bribing a gate guard - any action or event that has a chance of success or failure can be determined by one or more checks.

To make a check, you need three things. First, a pair of six-sided dice (often abbreviated as "d6".) Unlike other systems, {{ page.system_name }} does not require a set of specialized dice or tools to play, and six-sided dice can be found in many board games or at the corner store. The dice add an exciting random factor to the game - you'll never know if your actions will succeed or fail, but you can tilt the odds in your favor.

The second thing you need is the modifiers for that action. These are the game stats or numbers that affect how well your character can perform the action. Typically, these will include an Attribute Score and possibly the character's Skill Ranks (we'll learn about both of these a little later). For example, to climb up a rock wall, you would find your character's Body attributes score and his or her Athletics skill rank. Sometimes you will also have bonuses or penalties based on the current circumstances - a teammate cheering you on might grant a small bonus, whereas trying to climb in the wind or rain would impose a penalty.

The last thing you need is the target number (or "Difficulty") for the check. The more difficult the action, the higher the target number and the higher the roll needed to succeed.

> #### Where Do I Find The Difficulty?
>
> It depends on the type of action. Most actions fall into a handful of categories, such as Skill Checks or Attack Checks, which you will learn about as you continue through this document. For example, the difficulty of various skill-based tasks can be found in the Skills chapter.

### Performing A Check

To perform a check, roll two six-sided dice and add the result of the dice. Then add any relevant modifiers or values, such as a character or creature's attribute score or skill ranks. The sum of the dice and any applicable modifiers is called the **Check Result**.

To determine whether or not the action succeeded, you then compare the check result to the **Difficulty**. If the check result is greater than or equal to the difficulty, then the action succeeded. Otherwise, the action failed.

##### *Example*

Adara the holy paladin is trying to climb out of a box canyon with an orphan on her back before a flash flood washes her away. The canyon walls are firm and offer good hand- and footholds, so the Difficulty of the check is `10`.

Her player rolls two six-sided dice and gets a `3` and a `5`, for a result of `8`. Adara is quite strong and has a Body score of `5`, and her acolyte training has included rigorous physical conditioning, which is represented by an Athletics skill rank of `4`.

However, the weight of the child on her back slows her down, and the driving rain makes the climb treacherous. The Narrator rules that each of these is worth a `-3` penalty.

Adara's player finds the total check result by adding the dice and modifiers and arrives at a result of `8 + 5 + 4 - 3 - 3`, a total of `11`. Whew! Because her result was greater than or equal to the Difficulty, she successfully climbs out of the canyon just ahead of the rushing waters.

> #### How To Succeed At A Check
>
> Both the dice roll and your character's stats contribute to the check result. If your stats are high, which represents a high level of skill at the task, then you are likely to succeed at the check even if you get a bad roll. Conversely, even if your stats are low, you have a chance of success if the dice favor you.

### Critical Success and Critical Failure

Some actions are more complicated than a simple success-failure, and can have different results depending on how well the character succeeded or how badly he or she failed. These results are represented by a **Critical Success** or a **Critical Failure** on the check. For example, a critical success on an attack check might inflict additional damage on the target, or a critical failure on a climbing skill check might result in the character losing his or her grip and falling.

To achieve a critical success, you must get a check result at least `3` greater than the difficulty. Conversely, if your result is at least `3` less than the difficulty, then you suffer a critical failure. For example, on a difficulty of `12`, you will achieve a critical success on a result of `15` or higher, achieve a success on a result of `12` to `14`, suffer a failure on a result of `10` or `11`, or suffer a critical failure on a result of `9` or below.

### Taking Six

Rolling dice for a check is appropriate for chaotic or stressful conditions, such in a combat scene or another tense situation. Under more relaxed conditions, some checks may allow the player to **take six** and substitute a flat value of `6` in place of the dice roll. Not all checks allow the player to take six, and doing so is always at the Narrator's discretion.

### Opposed Checks

Not all actions have a fixed difficulty, particularly when the action is directly contested by another character or creature. This could be an arm-wrestling contest at the town inn, two mighty warriors with locked swords, or trying to convince the king of the evil chancellor's perfidy. These situations can be resolved using an **Opposed Check**.

An opposed check is similar to performing a regular check, but each participant rolls dice and adds their respective modifiers. Instead of comparing the results to a static difficulty, the results are compared with one another and the highest result wins the opposed check.

> #### Tiebreaker
>
> What happens when there is a tie? That's up to the Narrator. Sometimes the actions will cancel out. When a result in favor of one participant or another is required, here are a couple of recommended tiebreakers. The Narrator should always be consistent and clear on how ties are resolved.
>
> - *Compare Skill Ranks*: All else being equal, the more skilled participant should win the trial.
> - *Compare Spirit Scores*: Among other things, the Spirit attribute represents luck and fortune.
> - *The Character Wins*: The character is one of the heroes of the story, and the gods look down on them with favor.
> - *Flip A Coin*: Leave the decision in Lady Luck's capable hands.

## <a name="tokens"></a> Tokens

One of the most important goals in writing the {{ page.system_name }} game system is reducing the book-keeping and busywork required to play in other systems. One of the mechanisms used to accomplish this goal is the Token system. Tokens allow you to keep track of commonly-updated values such as health and mystical energy reserves without burying your table in bits of used eraser.

In essence, a **Token** represents an indivisible bit of something. Most commonly, you will use tokens to represent a character's vitality and wounds, but tokens can also be used to power some exciting game options, from a canny fighter's guard stance to a powerful mage's spells. Tokens can also be used to represent transient conditions, such as a venomous spider's bite slowly sapping your character's strength. At any given time, a character might have several different types of token.

> #### But I *Like* Pen And Paper!
>
> Great! {{ page.system_name }} is designed to be flexible about how you play. If you want to keep track of your character's status by writing down when you get or lose tokens instead of exchanging physical objects, don't let me get in your way! Just clear it with your Narrator, and make sure everyone else is on board to avoid confusion.
>
> Then again, you might give it a try and find out (as board game designers have always known) that moving physical bits and pieces around is part of the fun.

### Token Pools

Sometimes, you need to know not only how many tokens of a particular type the character has, but the maximum number he or she can have. This represents the character's maximum vitality, largest available mana pool, and so on. This value is called the maximum Token pool, which is typically shortened to **Token Pool**. Typically, this will be based on one of the character's attribute scores (we'll learn about those in a later chapter).

## Characters and Creatures

One of the core principles of the {{ page.system_name }} game system is that everyone plays by the same rules. In this document, we will use **Characters** to refer to the primary characters controlled by the players - typically humanoid, with one or more class levels and assorted benefits and bonuses. More generally, **Creatures** can refer to any game character, player-controlled or not, humanoid, monstrous, or anywhere in between. Most of the time, however, this is a distinction without a difference - any rule that applies to creatures also applies to the players' characters, and vice versa (with the exception of the rules on creating new characters).
